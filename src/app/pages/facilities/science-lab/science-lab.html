            Our state-of-the-art Physics laboratory is equipped with modern equipments to help the
            students learn the concepts of Physics with experiments. It is designed to give practice
            of taking measurements, analyzing data and drawing inferences while the students
            experiment.

            <br /><br />The lab is quite spacious and very well ventilated to ensure proper
            availability of light in it. Each of the laboratories can accommodate 30 students
            conducting experiments in groups of two depending on the experiment at hand.

            <br /><br />What makes its significance even stronger is the presence of the students
            and the teacher.

            At every stage in life, we are connected to different aspects of chemistry directly or
            indirectly. It encircles a variety of fields –agriculture, food, medicine, fertilizers,
            polymers, metals etc. Thus, the knowledge of chemistry is useful in different aspects of
            human life.

            <br /><br />Our chemistry lab aims to show our students the excitement of science.
            <br /><br />Raise the attainment in science by supporting the school curriculum.
            <br /><br />Inspire our students to become the scientists of the future.

            <br /><br />Our chemistry lab is well equipped with chemicals and other apparatus to
            cater to the needs of all the students up to class 12. Students start using the
            chemistry lab from class 6 onwards. They show great enthusiasm in using chemicals and
            perform hands on experiments. The lab has an excellent safety system with fire
            extinguishers and a shower cum eye washer equipment.

            <br /><br />The lab inculcates curiosity and inquisitiveness in students. It plays a
            very important role in developing a scientific temperament in our students
