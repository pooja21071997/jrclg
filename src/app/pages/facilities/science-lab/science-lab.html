        Our state-of-the-art Physics laboratory is equipped with modern equipments to help the
        students learn the concepts of Physics with experiments. It is designed to give practice of
        taking measurements, analyzing data and drawing inferences while the students experiment.

        <br /><br />The lab is quite spacious and very well ventilated to ensure proper availability
        of light in it. Each of the laboratories can accommodate 30 students conducting experiments
        in groups of two depending on the experiment at hand.

        <br /><br />What makes its significance even stronger is the presence of the students and
        the teacher.

        At every stage in life, we are connected to different aspects of chemistry directly or
        indirectly. It encircles a variety of fields –agriculture, food, medicine, fertilizers,
        polymers, metals etc. Thus, the knowledge of chemistry is useful in different aspects of
        human life.

        <br /><br />Our chemistry lab aims to show our students the excitement of science.
        <br />Raise the attainment in science by supporting the school curriculum. <br />Inspire our
        students to become the scientists of the future.

        <br /><br />Our chemistry lab is well equipped with chemicals and other apparatus to cater
        to the needs of all the students up to class 12. Students start using the chemistry lab from
        class 6 onwards. They show great enthusiasm in using chemicals and perform hands on
        experiments. The lab has an excellent safety system with fire extinguishers and a shower cum
        eye washer equipment.

        <br /><br />The lab inculcates curiosity and inquisitiveness in students. It plays a very
        important role in developing a scientific temperament in our students
